        description: "A hackathon is an intensive, 24–48 hour innovation marathon where students from all academic backgrounds come together to solve real-world problems through creativity, coding, and collaboration. Teams are formed on the spot or beforehand, and each team chooses a challenge—anything from designing a mobile app to improve mental health resources, to creating a prototype for sustainable energy solutions. Faculty, alumni, and local professionals often serve as mentors and judges, guiding participants and offering feedback. The event usually ends with presentations, where teams pitch their projects to a panel for prizes. Beyond the tech, hackathons foster teamwork, networking, and skill development, while keeping energy high with music, snacks, and even late-night pizza drops.",

Academic traditions—such as faculty marching in regalia, a procession of flags, or the recitation of the school’s pledge or anthem—reinforce the sense of history and pride. For new students, convocation symbolizes their official induction into the academic community. It’s formal, sometimes lengthy, but meaningful as it signals the beginning of a new chapter.",
